# Smart Farming AI Assistant

**Smart Farming AI Assistant** is a **Streamlit-based AI assistant** designed to empower farmers with intelligent crop and fertilizer recommendations. By analyzing soil nutrients, weather conditions, and moisture levels, it leverages **pre-trained machine learning models** to predict the most suitable crops and fertilizers. This helps farmers make **data-driven decisions**, enhance productivity, and optimize resource usage, ultimately reducing costs and improving yield efficiency.



## Features  

1. **ðŸŒ¾ Crop Recommendation**  
   - Predicts the most suitable crop for a given piece of land based on soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), temperature, humidity, soil pH, and rainfall.  
   - Uses a trained machine learning model (`crop_model.pkl`) to provide accurate suggestions, helping farmers maximize their yield.  

2. **ðŸ§ª Fertilizer Recommendation**  
   - Suggests the best fertilizer based on soil type, crop type, moisture level, temperature, humidity, and nutrient levels.  
   - Uses a trained model (`fertilizer_model.pkl`) to ensure optimal fertilization, improving soil health and reducing costs.  

3. **ðŸ“Š User-Friendly UI (Streamlit)**  
   - Provides an interactive interface where farmers can input their data easily using number inputs and dropdown menus.  
   - Displays instant recommendations in a simple and understandable format, making it accessible even for non-technical users.  

4. **ðŸš€ Fast & Efficient Predictions**  
   - Uses pre-trained machine learning models, making recommendations almost instantly without heavy processing.  
   - Can run on local devices or cloud servers, ensuring accessibility for farmers in different regions with varying internet and hardware capabilities.  
## Installation 

## 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-farming-ai.git
cd smart-farming-ai
```
OR

*Download the zip file*

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
