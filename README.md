# SmartFarmingAI

SmartFarmingAI is an AI-powered platform designed to help farmers optimize crop yields, monitor soil conditions, and improve overall farm management. The platform integrates AI models, data analytics, and IoT technologies to enhance agricultural productivity.

## Features

- **Soil Health Monitoring**: Integrates IoT sensors (e.g., moisture, temperature, pH sensors) into the soil to provide real-time data about soil conditions. The platform analyzes this data and offers recommendations on irrigation and fertilization.

- **Predictive Analytics for Crop Yield**: Employs machine learning to predict crop yields based on historical data, weather forecasts, and real-time sensor inputs, helping optimize resource usage and planning.

- **Automated Irrigation System**: Uses AI to optimize irrigation schedules by analyzing soil moisture levels, weather predictions, and specific crop needs, reducing water wastage.

- **Farm Management Dashboard**: Provides an intuitive dashboard for tracking soil conditions, water usage, and yield predictions, enabling informed decision-making.
